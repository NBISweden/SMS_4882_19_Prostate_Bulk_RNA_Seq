# Documents

**Doc directory**

This is the `doc` directory, in which you can store documents and information
from clients in their original form (*e.g.* selected papers, unformatted data,
project description, *etc.*).

**Data-managemet sub-folder**

The `data-management` directory contains
information about how to discuss data-related issues and data management plan (DMP) with the group (work-in-progress). See [README.md][sf-dmp] for suggestions how to share information and prepare a basic DMP with the group.
